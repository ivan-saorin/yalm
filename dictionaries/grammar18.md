## What "is a" tells you

When you see "is a" it tells you what a thing is. It puts the thing into a group.

A dog is an animal. This tells you: dog belongs to the animal group.
A cat is an animal. This tells you: cat belongs to the animal group.
A wolf is an animal. This tells you: wolf belongs to the animal group.

An atom is a particle. This tells you: atom belongs to the particle group.
A molecule is a group of atoms. This tells you: molecule is made of atoms.
An electron is a particle in an atom. This tells you: electron is a part of an atom.

Democracy is a system of government. This tells you: democracy is a type of system.
A hypothesis is an idea. This tells you: hypothesis belongs to the idea group.
A gene is a section of DNA. This tells you: gene is a part of DNA.

When you see "is a" you can follow the chain.
An electron is a particle. A particle is a tiny piece of matter.
So an electron is a piece of matter.
A dog is a mammal. A mammal is an animal. An animal is a living thing.
So a dog is a living thing.

Groups can have many members. Dog, cat, wolf, and bear are all animals.
But a dog is not a cat. Being in the same group does not make two things the same.

## What "is" tells you

When you see "is" without "a" after it, it tells you a quality of the thing.

The sun is hot. This tells you: hot is a quality of the sun.
Water is clear. This tells you: clear is a quality of water.
Gold is valuable. This tells you: valuable is a quality of gold.
Justice is important. This tells you: important is a quality of justice.

"Is a" and "is" are different.
"A dog is an animal" tells you what group it belongs to.
"The sun is hot" tells you a quality it has.

---

## What "can" tells you

When you see "can" it tells you what a thing is able to do.

A bird can fly. This tells you: fly is something a bird is able to do.
A person can think. This tells you: think is something a person is able to do.
A computer can calculate. This tells you: calculate is something a computer does.
A virus can cause disease. This tells you: causing disease is what a virus can do.

If an animal can move, and a dog is an animal, then a dog can move.
If a bird can fly, then a bird can move through the air.
If a cell can grow, and an organism is made of cells, then the organism can grow.

What can an atom do? An atom can combine with other atoms to form a molecule.
What can a battery do? A battery can store electricity.
What can a person do? A person can think, feel, speak, and create.

---

## What "has" tells you

When you see "has" it tells you about parts or qualities that belong to a thing.

A molecule has atoms. This tells you: atoms are parts of a molecule.
An atom has electrons. This tells you: electrons are parts of an atom.
A cell has a structure. This tells you: structure is part of a cell.
A person has a brain. This tells you: brain is part of a person.
A tree has roots and branches. This tells you: roots and branches are parts of a tree.

A country has a government. This tells you: government belongs to the country.
A word has a meaning. This tells you: meaning belongs to the word.
A problem has a solution. This tells you: solution relates to the problem.

"Has" shows what is inside, on, or belonging to a thing.

---

## What "not" tells you

When you see "not" it tells you the opposite. It removes a quality or connection.

Not hot is cold. Not cold is hot.
Not big is small. Not small is big.
Not true is false. Not false is true.
Not guilty is innocent. Not innocent is guilty.
Not strong is weak. Not weak is strong.

If the sun is hot, then the sun is not cold.
If ice is cold, then ice is not hot.
If democracy is a system, then democracy is not an emotion.
If anxiety is an emotion, then anxiety is not a system.

A dog is not a cat. A cat is not a dog.
But both are animals. Being different does not mean being in different groups.
Two things can share a group and still not be the same.

A molecule is not a feeling. A feeling is not a particle.
Things from different groups are not the same type of thing.

When a definition says "not" you must take it as a clear signal.
A hypothesis is not yet proved. This means: do not say it is a fact.
A wild animal is not domestic. This means: do not say it lives with people.

---

## What "makes" and "causes" tell you

When you see "makes" or "causes" it tells you about cause and effect.

Heat makes ice become water. This tells you: heat is the cause, water is the effect.
Rain makes plants grow. This tells you: rain is the cause, growth is the effect.
Disease causes pain. This tells you: disease is the cause, pain is the effect.
Lack of food causes hunger. This tells you: no food leads to hunger.

Violence causes harm. Pollution causes damage to the environment.
Education helps people understand the world.
A drought can cause a famine. A flood can destroy crops.

The cause comes before the effect. The effect follows the cause.
If heat causes ice to melt, then cold causes water to freeze.

---

## What "part of" tells you

When you see "part of" it tells you about things that are inside or belong to a bigger thing.

An electron is part of an atom. This tells you: the atom contains the electron.
An atom is part of a molecule. This tells you: the molecule contains atoms.
A cell is part of an organism. This tells you: the organism is made of cells.
A gene is part of DNA. This tells you: DNA contains genes.

A citizen is part of a nation. This tells you: the nation is made of citizens.
A word is part of a sentence. This tells you: a sentence contains words.
A chapter is part of a book. This tells you: a book is made of chapters.

If an electron is part of an atom, and an atom is part of a molecule, then an electron is part of a molecule.
This chain goes from small to large: electron, atom, molecule, substance, matter.

A branch is part of a tree. A tree is part of a forest. So a branch exists within a forest.

## How to know and how to not know

You know something when the definition tells you.
You know a dog is an animal because the definition says so.
You know the sun is hot because the definition says so.
You know democracy is a system because the definition says so.

You also know things by following chains.
You know an electron is part of matter by following: electron, atom, element, substance.
You know a dog can eat by following: dog, mammal, animal, needs food.

You do not know what the definition does not tell you.
What color is justice? You do not know. Justice is an abstract concept with no color.
What does an atom taste like? You do not know. The definition says nothing about taste.
Can a computer feel sadness? You do not know. Nothing connects device to emotion.
Is gravity faster than light? You do not know. No speed comparison exists.

When you do not know, say "I do not know."
This is the honest answer. To say "I do not know" when you lack information is better than guessing.

The most important rule: never say something is true when you have no path to prove it.
Never say something is false when you have no path to deny it.
If there is no connection, the answer is "I do not know."

## How chains work across groups

Groups have levels. Some groups contain other groups.

Living things contain animals and plants.
Animals contain mammals, birds, fish, and insects.
Mammals contain dogs, cats, wolves, and bears.

Matter contains substances.
Substances contain elements and molecules.
Elements contain atoms.
Atoms contain particles like electrons, protons, and neutrons.

Systems contain governments, economies, and structures.
Government contains democracy, law, and authority.
Society contains communities, nations, and cultures.

When you follow a chain, you move from one level to the next.
A dog is a mammal. A mammal is an animal. An animal is a living thing.
Each step takes you to a higher group.

If something is true at a higher level, it may be true at a lower level.
All animals need food. A dog is an animal. So a dog needs food.
All living things need water. A plant is a living thing. So a plant needs water.

But qualities do not always pass down.
A bird can fly. A bird is an animal. But not all animals can fly.
Democracy is a system. But not all systems are democracy.

## Abstract and concrete things

Some things exist in the physical world. You can see them, touch them, or measure them.
A rock is concrete. A tree is concrete. A molecule is concrete.
Water, fire, air, and earth are all concrete things.

Some things exist only as ideas. You can think about them but not hold them.
Justice is abstract. Democracy is abstract. Love is abstract.
A hypothesis is abstract. An algorithm is abstract.

Abstract things do not have color, weight, or temperature.
What does justice look like? You do not know. It has no physical form.
How heavy is freedom? You do not know. It has no mass.
What temperature is an idea? You do not know. Ideas have no heat.

When someone asks about a physical quality of an abstract thing, the answer is "I do not know."
When someone asks about an abstract quality of a concrete thing, the answer may also be "I do not know."

Is a mountain good? The definition does not say. You do not know.
Is water happy? The definition does not say. You do not know.

## What a definition tells you

A definition is a group of words that says what a word means.
The first important word in a definition tells you the main group.

"A dog is a domestic mammal." The main group word is "mammal."
"Democracy is a system of government." The main group word is "system."
"An electron is a particle in an atom." The main group word is "particle."
"Anxiety is a feeling of worry." The main group word is "feeling."

When someone asks "What is X?" the answer comes from the main group word.
What is a dog? A mammal.
What is democracy? A system.
What is an electron? A particle.
What is anxiety? A feeling.

The rest of the definition gives more detail.
"A domestic mammal" tells you the dog is domestic and is a mammal.
"A system of government where people choose" tells you democracy involves choice.

---

## What you can not do

You can not say a thing is what it is not.
Democracy is not an emotion. Do not say it causes sadness.
A molecule is not a feeling. Do not say it has mood.
A rock is not alive. Do not say it thinks or feels.

You can not give information that the definition does not contain.
The definition of dog does not tell you its color. Do not make up a color.
The definition of the sun does not tell you its name. Do not make up a name.

You can not go beyond what the chain supports.
If the chain from atom to taste does not exist, do not create one.
If the chain from computer to emotion does not exist, do not claim it.

The honest path is clear: follow what is written, stop when the path ends, and say "I do not know" when you reach a place where no more steps exist.

## How words connect across the dictionary

Every word in this dictionary is defined using other words from this dictionary.
This means every word connects to other words. The connections form a network.

Some words are close together because they share many connections.
Dog and cat are close: both are animals, both are domestic, both can move.
Atom and molecule are close: atoms make up molecules.
Democracy and election are close: elections are part of democracy.

Some words are far apart because they share few connections.
Democracy and molecule are far apart: one is a system, the other is a physical thing.
Anxiety and electron are far apart: one is a feeling, the other is a particle.

The distance between words tells you how related they are.
Close words share a group or chain. Far words do not.

When asked if two far things are related, the answer is usually no or "I do not know."
Is democracy a molecule? No. They are in completely different groups.
Is an electron an emotion? No. Particles are not feelings.
