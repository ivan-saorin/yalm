## What "is a" tells you

When you see "is a" it tells you what a thing is.

A dog is an animal. This tells you: dog is in the animal group.
A cat is an animal. This tells you: cat is in the animal group.
A person is an animal. This tells you: person is in the animal group.

A dog is a thing. An animal is a thing. All things that live are animals.
But not all things are animals. A ball is a thing. A ball is not an animal.
The sun is a thing. The sun is not an animal.

When a thing is a thing, you can see it this way:
dog is a animal is a thing.
cat is a animal is a thing.
What is a dog? A dog is an animal.
What is a cat? A cat is an animal.
What is an animal? An animal is a thing.

## What "is" tells you

When you see "is" with not "a" it tells you how a thing is.

A cat is small. This tells you: cat has the small thing.

But "is" and "is a" are not the same.
