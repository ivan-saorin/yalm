We made a list of the things to be taken, and a pretty lengthy one it was, before we parted that evening. The next day, which was Friday, we got them all together, and met in the evening to pack. We got a big Gladstone for the clothes, and a couple of hampers for the victuals and the cooking utensils. We moved the table up against the window, piled everything in a heap in the middle of the floor, and sat round and looked at it. I said I would pack.

I rather pride myself on my packing. Packing is one of those many things that I feel I know more about than any other person living. I impressed the fact upon George and Harris, and told them that they had better leave the whole matter entirely to me. They fell into the suggestion with a readiness that had something uncanny about it. George put on a pipe and spread himself over the easy chair, and Harris cocked his legs on the table and lit a cigar.

However, I did not say anything, but started the packing. It seemed a longer job than I had thought it was going to be; but I got the bag finished at last, and I sat on it and strapped it.

Harris said, are you not going to put the boots in? And I looked round, and found I had forgotten them. That is just like Harris. He could not have said a word until I had got the bag shut and strapped, of course. And George laughed.

I opened the bag and packed the boots in; and then, just as I was going to close it, a horrible idea occurred to me. Had I packed my tooth brush?

Of course I had to turn every mortal thing out now, and, of course, I could not find it. I put the things back one by one, and held everything up and shook it. Then I found it inside a boot. I repacked once more.

When I had finished, George asked if the soap was in. I said I did not care whether the soap was in or whether it was not; and I slammed the bag to and strapped it, and found that I had packed my tobacco pouch in it, and had to reopen it. It got shut up finally, and then there remained the hampers to do. Harris said that he and George had better do the rest; and I agreed and sat down, and they had a go.

They began in a light hearted spirit, evidently intending to show me how to do it. They started with breaking a cup. That was the first thing they did. Then Harris packed the strawberry jam on top of a tomato and squashed it. And then it was George's turn, and he trod on the butter.

They upset salt over everything, and as for the butter, I never saw two men do more with butter in my whole life than they did. After George had got it off his slipper, they tried to put it in the kettle. They did scrape it out at last, and put it down on a chair, and Harris sat on it, and it stuck to him, and they went looking for it all over the room.

Montmorency was in it all, of course. Montmorency's ambition in life, is to get in the way and be sworn at. He came and sat down on things, just when they were wanted to be packed; and he put his leg into the jam, and he worried the teaspoons, and he pretended that the lemons were rats, and got into the hamper and killed three of them before Harris could land him with the frying pan.

Harris said I encouraged him. I did not encourage him. A dog like that does not want any encouragement. It is the natural, original sin that is born in him that makes him do things like that.

The packing was done at last; and Harris sat on the big hamper, and said he hoped nothing would be found broken.
