## Key Observations

1. **"something"** is the single most pervasive leaked word, appearing in the definitions of 144 entries. It is the backbone word of nearly every definition ("something that..."). Defining it will close a huge number of leaks.

2. **"that"** appears in 85+ definitions as a relative pronoun/conjunction. Essential to define.

3. **"for"** and **"from"** appear in 28+ and 36+ definitions respectively. These prepositions are critical.

4. **Function words** (that, for, from, by, at, into, out, over, etc.) account for a large fraction of definition leaks. Defining ~25 function words will close hundreds of leak instances.

5. The **example-only leaks** (284 words) can all be eliminated by rewriting examples without changing definitions, keeping the vocabulary expansion measured rather than inflated.

6. Many leaked words are **irregular verb forms** (made, done, gone, came, went, said, etc.) that need their own entries since the closure rule only allows regular inflections.

7. The current dictionary claims ~400 entries and "NEAR-CLOSED" status. The actual leak count of 695 words shows it is far from closed.

## Expansion Estimate

- Current entries: 452
- New entries needed (definition leaks): ~411
- Estimated total after closure: ~863+
- This will likely introduce secondary leaks requiring another ~50-100 entries
- **Projected final count: ~900-1000 entries**
- **Projected expansion ratio: ~18-20x** (vs. dict5's 50 words)
